<p>
    Fisch cakes have been a staple in my household. Especially during those days when we need eat well on a budget. With basically just a can of tuna, you can have a delicious meal!
</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
    <li>2 cans of tuna</li>
    <li>1 large egg </li>
    <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
    <li>2 green onions, diced</li>
    <li>1/2 onion, cut into strips</li>
    <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Place all ingredients, except for the breadcrumbs, in a large bowl and mash until thoroughly combined.</li>
    <li>Form the mixture into 8 equal patties and roll them in the panko breadcrumbs. Refrigerate the patties for at least 30 minutes or until they've firmed up.</li>
    <li>Heat some oil in a non-stick pan and fry the patties on each side for 3-4 minutes until lightly browned, being careful not to overcrowd the pan.</li>
    <li>Serve immediately. Taste great with tarter sauce or ketchup! </li>
